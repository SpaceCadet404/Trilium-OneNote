# Trilium OneNote
A clone of OneNote's colorscheme. A bad CSS hack of [Midnight by cwilliams](https://github.com/cwilliams5/Midnight-Trilium-Dark-Mode).

Supported Trilium version: 0.50.1.

## Prerequisites
Technically none, theme will try and fetch the fonts it uses from the web. For offline use, or if any problems encountered, please manually install the following fonts:
* [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) - A beautiful font designed specifically for screen use and works well in dark mode compared to default Trilium fonts.
* [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) - The best programming font, great dark mode look and programming ligatures. 

## Installation
* Create a new note in Trilium, store it anywhere you would like.
* Change note type to CSS.
* Paste in the raw contents of onenote.css.
* Add an owned attribute of without the quotes "#appTheme=OneNote" to the note.
* Click the Trilium icon in the top left, select options, and under theme select OneNote.
